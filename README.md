# üß† Intelligent Query Engine: A Modern AI-Powered Query System

This repository hosts the **Intelligent Query Engine**, an AI-driven query solution that integrates advanced natural language processing with robust database querying. The system leverages state-of-the-art AI models, vector databases, and traditional relational databases to provide seamless, intelligent interactions with your data.

## üå± Features

- **Google Gemini and Hugging Face Embeddings**: Harnesses the power of cutting-edge language models to understand natural language queries and convert them into precise SQL statements.
- **ChromaDB for Vector Storage**: Efficiently stores and retrieves embeddings for context-aware querying and semantic search.
- **MySQL Backend**: Queries structured data stored in a traditional relational database, ensuring compatibility with existing workflows.
- **LangChain Integration**: Chains complex logic and workflows, enabling multi-step querying and decision-making.
- **Notebook-Based Development**: Experimentation and prototyping in a flexible, interactive environment.

## üí° Key Capabilities

1. **Natural Language to SQL**: Users can ask questions in plain English, and the engine generates accurate SQL queries to fetch results from MySQL.
2. **Semantic Search**: Find relevant information using vector-based similarity searches stored in ChromaDB.
3. **Dynamic Context Management**: Adapts to user queries with contextual understanding powered by Google Gemini and Hugging Face embeddings.
4. **Scalability**: Designed to handle large datasets and complex queries with ease.
5. **Modular Design**: Extensible architecture for integrating additional AI models or database systems.

### üîÑ Flow Explanation:
1. **User Query (Natural Language)**: The user inputs a query in natural language.
2. **Google Gemini / Hugging Face Embeddings**: These models process and embed the query into a format suitable for understanding and further processing.
3. **LangChain**: Orchestrates the multi-step process and integrates different components.
4. **ChromaDB**: Stores vector embeddings for context-based search, aiding in query understanding.
5. **MySQL Database**: The relational database where the actual data resides.
6. **SQL Query Generation**: Translates the processed natural language query into a precise SQL statement.
7. **Final Results**: The result of the query execution is returned to the user.
